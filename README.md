# Data Science application showcase

Objective: Predict whether future rockets will successfully land. 

Part1. Complete the Data Collection API Lab.
Data was collected from the SpaceX API to analyze Falcon 9 rocket launches. 
Results were compiled and saved in the file dataset_part_1.csv

Part2. Scrape the Wikipedia page containing Falcon 9 launch data using BeautifulSoup. 
Launch records were extracted from the HTML table, parsed, and then transformed into a DataFrame.

Part3. Perform exploratory data analysis to predict Booster landing outcomes.

Part4. Enhance your understanding of the SpaceX dataset by loading it into a database and performing queries.
